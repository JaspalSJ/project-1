The Pakavāna Website

    The Pakavāna website is a landing page for an Indian restaurant, Pakavāna being the Punjabi word for cuisine.

    Users of the website will be able to see some brief information about the restaurant, a gallery of food cooked at the restaurant, a page to contact the restaurant and the opening times of the restaurant on the home page and contact us page.

Features

    Navigation

        At the top of each page, the user can navigate the site with a navigation menu, the main logo on the right leads to the home page, as does the home button. The About button leads to the About page, the Gallery button leads to the Gallery page, and the Contact Us button leads to the Contact Us page.

    Contact Us

        The Contact Us page features a form that the users can use to contact the restaurant over any concerns they have. It requires the user to input a first and last name, their email address, select the nature of the message and the text area to write their concern. The selection menu currently features compliments, complaints, lost items and general feedback. Like the Home page, the Contact Us page features a section for the Opening Times at the bottom.

    Footer

        On each page, a footer is found fixed in the bottom left position that leads to the restaurant's Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram pages. At this time each link leads to the social media site's home page as the restaurant social media currently does not exist.

Testing

    I have confirmed that the project is responsive and functions on standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.

    I have confirmed that the navigation, header, footer and all text are easy to read and easy to understand.

    I have confirmed that the form works and requires an email in the email field, and the submit button works.

    Bugs and Known Issues

        The navigation menu will change the order and layout of its buttons when the site is viewed on smaller screens, but does not lose its functionality and clarity

        The footer is presently fixed in the bottom left of the screen, and should be fixed at the bottom of the page instead.
        
        There is a large gap between the images and the main text on the Home page and the About page, when viewed on a desktop screen.

Validator testing

    HTML

        No errors were found in the HTML code for the site when passing through the W3C validator

    CSS

        No errors were found in the CSS code for the site when passing through the official (jigsaw) validator
    
    Accessibility

        I confirmed the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible to the user by running it through the lighthouse in devtools, there are however some performance issues with the site.

Deployment

    The site was deployed to GitHub pages, the steps to deploy are as follows:

        In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
        In the left sidebar, in the Code and Automation section, there is a page called Pages.
        In the source drop-down menu, select the main branch and save, the page will then serve the link to the completed website.
